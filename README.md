# Game of Life in Golang

## Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life in Golang. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 

## Features
- Uses Golang to simulate the cellular automaton.
- Provides a console-based interface to visualize the game.
- Includes basic patterns and rules defined by Conway's Game of Life.

## Requirements
- Go 1.22 or higher

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Run
```bash
go run main.go
```
